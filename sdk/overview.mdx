# SDK Overview

The SecureLend SDK is organized around resources, each corresponding to a different financial product category. You can access these resources as properties on the main `securelend` client instance.

## Resources

The SDK currently supports the following resources:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Loans" href="/sdk/loans">
    Compare business loan offers and calculate payments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Banking" href="/sdk/banking">
    Find and compare business banking accounts. (Coming Soon)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credit Cards" href="/sdk/credit-cards">
    Compare business credit card offers. (Coming Soon)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Initialization

First, initialize the client with your API key:

```typescript
import { SecureLend } from "@securelend/sdk";

const securelend = new SecureLend(process.env.SECURELEND_API_KEY);
```

## Accessing Resources

Once initialized, you can access the API resources through the client instance. Each resource provides methods for interacting with its respective API endpoints.

```typescript
// Access the loans resource
await securelend.loans.compare(...);

// Access the banking resource (example)
// await securelend.banking.compare(...);
```

## TypeScript and Intellisense

The SDK is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. This provides a great developer experience with autocompletion and type checking in modern editors like VS Code.

You can import types directly from the package:

```typescript
import type { LoanOffer, BusinessProfile } from '@securelend/sdk';

function processOffer(offer: LoanOffer) {
  // Your logic here
}
```

## Error Handling

The SDK provides custom error classes to help you handle different failure scenarios gracefully. See the [Error Handling guide](/guides/errors) for detailed information.
