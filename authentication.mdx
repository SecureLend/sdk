# Authentication

The SecureLend SDK uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [SecureLend Dashboard](https://dashboard.securelend.ai/settings/keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

## Using API Keys

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

To authenticate, you need to provide your secret key when initializing the client:

```typescript
import { SecureLend } from '@securelend/sdk';

const client = new SecureLend('sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
```

We strongly recommend using environment variables to manage your API keys and avoid committing them to version control.

```typescript
// Best practice: use environment variables
const client = new SecureLend(process.env.SECURELEND_API_KEY);
```

If you provide an invalid or expired API key, the SDK will throw an `AuthenticationError`. See the [Error Handling](/guides/errors) guide for more details.
