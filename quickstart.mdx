# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through installing the SDK, authenticating, and making your first API call to compare business loans.

## 1. Installation

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager.

```bash
npm install @securelend/sdk
```

## 2. Get your API Key

You'll need an API key to authenticate with SecureLend. You can get your key from the [SecureLend Dashboard](https://dashboard.securelend.ai).

## 3. Initialize the Client

Import the `SecureLend` client and initialize it with your API key. We recommend using an environment variable to store your key.

```typescript
import { SecureLend } from "@securelend/sdk";

const securelend = new SecureLend(process.env.SECURELEND_API_KEY);
```

## 4. Compare Loan Offers

Now you're ready to make your first API call. Let's compare business loan offers.

```typescript
async function compareBusinessLoans() {
  try {
    const result = await securelend.loans.compare({
      amount: 200000,
      purpose: "equipment",
      business: {
        revenue: 1200000,
        creditScore: 720,
        timeInBusiness: 36,
      },
    });

    console.log(`Found ${result.summary.totalOffers} offers.`);
    
    const bestOffer = result.offers[0];
    if (bestOffer) {
      console.log("Best offer details:");
      console.log(`- Lender: ${bestOffer.lender.name}`);
      console.log(`- Rate: ${bestOffer.terms.interestRate.rate}%`);
      console.log(`- Monthly Payment: $${bestOffer.terms.monthlyPayment}`);
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
}

compareBusinessLoans();
```

That's it! You've successfully compared loan offers using the SecureLend SDK.
